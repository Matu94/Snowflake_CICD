/* I use Keypair auth so here is have to set it up:
using OpenSSL on local machine. Run this commands in the terminal

This command generates a private key and encrypts it using the AES 256 algorithm, which will prompt you to enter and verify a passphrase. REMEMBER FOR THIS PASSPHRASE
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out snowflake_cicd_key.p8 -v2 aes-256-cbc

Generates public key:
openssl rsa -in snowflake_cicd_key.p8 -pubout -out snowflake_cicd_key.pub

So end of the day we have 2 files: 
.p8 is the private key
.pub is the publick key
*/

-- Add the publick key to the user:
ALTER USER CICD_USER
    SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'putyourpublichere_withouttheBEGINandENDPUBLICKEY_and_inoneline';
